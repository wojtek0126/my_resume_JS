# my_resume_JS
This is my CV made with React JS
It is constantly evolving. 
This time, I started with mobile first which made it much easier to build responsiveness faster
At current stage I am thinking about adding some simple form to showcase API along with some simple validations for inputs.
Tech used: Javascript, node.js, React.js, styled with sass
